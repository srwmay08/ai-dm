    "description": "An ancient, sentient artifact created by the aboleth Golorr. It appears as a smooth, palm-sized stone of greenish-gray material, but its surface writhes with barely-perceptible psychic energy. It holds the memories of its previous owners and the secrets of Lord Neverember's hidden vault. The Stone is not a creature in the traditional sense, but a malevolent intelligence that can dominate and destroy the minds of those who possess it.",
