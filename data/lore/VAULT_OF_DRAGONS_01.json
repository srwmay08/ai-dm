    "content": "Hidden somewhere in the city, its location a secret known only to the Stone of Golorr, lies the Vault of Dragons. This is not some ancient treasure hoard, but a cleverly constructed strongroom built to hide the greatest theft in Waterdeep's history. During his time as Open Lord, Dagult Neverember embezzled half a million gold dragons from the city's coffers. To keep his ill-gotten gains safe, he constructed this secret vault. The vault is protected by powerful magic and cunning traps, designed to thwart any who would seek to claim its contents. Its ultimate guardian, however, is its most unusual feature: Aurinax, an adult gold dragon. Neverember struck a deal with the noble dragon, entrusting him with the Dragonstaff of Ahghairon and charging him with guarding the vault until Neverember or his designated agents came to claim the gold. Aurinax, bound by his honor, has remained a faithful guardian, unaware that the treasure he protects was stolen from the very people of the city he now resides under. The vault represents a life-changing fortune, a prize that has drawn the attention of every major power in Waterdeep's underworld."
