    "title": "The Xanathar Guild Hideout (Candle Lane Sewers)",
    "content": "Beneath the streets of the Dock Ward, hidden deep within the city's labyrinthine sewer system, lies one of the Xanathar Guild's many forward operating posts. This particular hideout, accessible via a secret entrance near Candle Lane, serves as a staging ground for kidnappings, interrogations, and smuggling runs. It is a foul, damp place, consisting of a few crudely repurposed sewer chambers connected by slimy passages. The air is thick with the stench of refuse and the faint, coppery scent of old blood. Here, low-level thugs and ambitious underlings carry out the guild's dirty work, far from the prying eyes of the City Watch. The hideout is often overseen by a mid-level boss, like the bugbear Grum'shar, and is where the guild holds prisoners before they are either ransomed or sent deeper into the Xanathar's territory. It is a testament to the guild's reach that they can operate such a facility right under the noses of the city's authorities, using the vast network of sewers as their private highway for illicit activities. While not the center of power, it is a vital node in the guild's criminal network."
