    "title": "The Rescue of Floon Blagmaar",
    "content": "Following their adventure in the djinni's bottle, the party was hired by the famed author Volothamp Geddarm at the Yawning Portal to find his missing friend, Floon Blagmaar. Volo was concerned for his friend, who had disappeared after a night of drinking at a seedy tavern called the Skewered Dragon. The investigation led the party to the tavern, where the bartender, Maeve, reluctantly pointed them toward a Zhentarim warehouse on Candle Lane. Inside the warehouse, the party discovered a scene of carnage from a gang fight and were ambushed by Kenku working for the Xanathar Guild. After defeating them, they found not Floon, but Renaer Neverember, the estranged son of Waterdeep's former Open Lord, hiding in a back room. Renaer explained that he and Floon had been kidnapped together by the Zhentarim, who were seeking information about his father's rumored vault of gold. The warehouse was then attacked by the rival Xanathar Guild, who mistook Floon for Renaer and took him into the sewers. Following yellow signs left by the Xanathar Guild, the party delved into the city's sewers, battling a Gazer, rat swarms, a rat-like halfling brawler, giant frogs, and a bugbear guarding a Xanathar outpost. Inside the hideout, they fought through goblin guards and a Gray Ooze before finally locating Floon in a ceremonial hall. He had been mentally tortured, leaving him dazed and traumatized. The party escaped with Floon and Renaer through a secret cellar passage that emerged directly into the chaos of the Fleetswake festival parade, eventually returning Floon to the safety of Renaer's villa."
