    "content": "Ask any soul in the City of Splendors how we got so splendid, and they'll tell you it wasn't always this way. The story goes that before any of us were here, dwarves were digging around under the mountain, and they were the first to see what a fine harbor this was. But it was men who built the first real town here, a tough old sea captain named Nimoar, they say. He built a wall to keep the trolls out, and for that, we're all thankful. After him came the War Lords. Now those were dark times. They were a greedy, angry bunch who cared more for fighting than for folk. The city nearly tore itself apart under their rule, just one big brawl from the docks to the fields. Then came Ahghairon. Now there's a name you raise a glass to! He was a wizard, the greatest wizard, who got tired of all the senseless fighting. He put the last War Lord in his place and said, 'No more.' He's the one who came up with the Masked Lords. Nobody knows who they areâ€”could be the baker, could be the lady selling fish, could be a noble in his manor. That's the beauty of it! They watch over us, make the laws, and keep us safe, all from behind their masks so no one can bribe 'em or threaten their families. Ahghairon was the first Open Lord, the only one we all knew, and he made Waterdeep what it is today. Thanks to him, the guilds got strong, the Watch keeps the peace, and those lads on the griffons keep the skies clear. Sure, we've had our troubles. Not long ago, we had that Lord Neverember from Neverwinter running things. A real piece of work, that one. Smiled for the crowds but folks say he lined his own pockets with our gold before he was sent packing. Now we've got Lady Laeral Silverhand. She's a legend, a powerful mage like old Ahghairon himself. Things feel safer with her at the helm. She's been cleaning up the mess Neverember left, and for that, we're grateful. It's a grand city, Waterdeep. A city of laws, a city of opportunity, all thanks to a wise old wizard and the secret lords he put in charge."
