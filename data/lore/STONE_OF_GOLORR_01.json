    "title": "The Stone of Golorr",
    "content": "The Stone of Golorr is not a mere gemstone, but a powerful, ancient, and malevolent artifact. It is believed to have been created by the Abolethic Sovereignty, a terrifying empire of psionic aberrations from a bygone age. The Stone itself is an oblong, fist-sized stone of an unsettling, oily black material, but its true nature is far more sinister: it is a sapient being with a vast repository of knowledge and a will of its own. Golorr communicates telepathically, feeding information to its wielder, but its motives are alien and its influence corrupting. The Stone's primary function is to absorb and store information, acting as an infallible key to forgotten lore. Crucially, it has absorbed the knowledge of the location of Lord Neverember's secret vault of embezzled gold, making it the most sought-after object in Waterdeep's underworld. The Stone is not a passive tool; it can alter its appearance, wipe memories of its existence from the minds of those who lose it, and even create magical 'eyes'â€”smaller stones that must be gathered to fully unlock its power. It is a prize that has driven the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim into open war, a conflict that threatens to spill out and consume the entire City of Splendors."
