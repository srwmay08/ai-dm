    "title": "The Third Eye (The Cassalanters' Eye)",
    "content": "The third Eye is the best-kept secret in the conflict. It is held by the noble Cassalanter family, who are secretly the leaders of a devil-worshipping cult. They obtained the Eye through their own shadowy means and keep it hidden within their villa, likely in a secret compartment or on the person of a trusted cultist. Unlike the other factions, the Cassalanters have avoided the open street violence, preferring to watch their rivals weaken each other. They are playing a patient game, waiting for the other pieces to fall into place before revealing their hand and making a move for the Stone and the Vault. Their possession of this Eye makes them a dangerous and underestimated player in the grand game."
