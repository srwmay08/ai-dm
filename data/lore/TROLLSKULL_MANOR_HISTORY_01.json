    "content": "Trollskull Manor, a venerable but ill-fated edifice in Trollskull Alley, bears a history as checkered as the cobblestones outside its doors. Its very stones seem to hum with the echoes of its past, a blend of ambition, tragedy, and unsettling mystery. The manor was originally conceived as a grand tavern around 1380 DR by the dwarf Ulkoria Stonemarrow, and for nearly fifteen years, the 'Stonemarrow's Hearth' thrived. She sold the establishment around 1395 DR to return to adventuring. The tavern then passed to the Ironbrew family of shield dwarves, who ran it for over two decades until dwindling fortunes forced them to sell in 1420 DR. Its next owner, Arissa Mirthkettle, deceptively converted the manor into an orphanage from 1420 DR to 1427 DR. In truth, she was a monstrous hag using the orphanage as a larder. After her discovery, the property was abandoned for a decade, tainted by her horrific deeds. Around 1437 DR, a hopeful half-elf named Lif acquired the deed, restoring it to a tavern. Tragedy struck in 1452 DR when he was killed in a horrific accident, his spirit becoming a poltergeist bound to the manor. The Morley couple bought it next, but were driven to bankruptcy by 1470 DR due to the haunting and a severe economic recession. After changing hands multiple times, a halfling clan, the Curlbottoms, used it as a private residence from 1476 DR to 1484 DR before leaving for Neverwinter. Most recently, the property was purchased at auction by Volothamp Geddarm, who researched its haunting for a book before growing bored and gifting the deed to the current party in 1492 DR."
