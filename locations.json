  "description": "A grand manor house that stands silhouetted against the fading light, its gables and chimneys reaching like skeletal fingers toward the sky. It sags with the weight of time and neglect, its facade a patchwork of faded paint and peeling plaster. Many of its windows are dark, shattered panes like vacant eyes staring out into the alley. The heavy oak front door is scarred and weathered, and the very stones seem to hum with a subtle, disquieting energy.",

Before you, the manor stands, undeniably impressive in scale but sagging with the weight of time and neglect. Its once proud facade is now a patchwork of faded paint and peeling plaster. Shattered window panes are like vacant eyes staring out, and the heavy oak front door is scarred and weathered, its polished brass knocker tarnished green with age.",

Ahead of you stands a long, mahogany bar, its surface dull and scarred. The air here feels heavier, a lingering phantom scent of stale ale and distant merriment. Empty, overturned stools lie scattered like fallen soldiers, and shattered tankards litter the floor, glittering like broken jewels in the gloom. A chill, colder than the rest of the house, seems to emanate from the collapsed remains of a support beam near the bar, which pins the splintered remains of several ale casks.",
