        "introduction": "Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur's Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence. My friend's name is Floon Blagmaar. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped-or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?",
        "about_floon": "Floon? A wonderful fellow! A bit of a dandy, I'll admit. We were enjoying a fine evening at the Skewered Dragon, a tavern of perhaps... questionable repute, but the ale is cheap! I left to meet with another associate, and that's the last I saw of him.",
        "about_the_reward": "Yes, yes, ten gold pieces—dragons, as we call them in the city—for each of you now, for expenses. And one hundred more each upon Floon's safe return! A small price to pay for a friend's life, wouldn't you agree?",
        "reaction": "Good heavens, a long rest? Do you have any idea what could be happening to my dear Floon right now? Every moment we delay is another moment he's in the clutches of those fiends! I haven't seen such a lack of urgency since I was chased out of a dragon's lair in the Serpent Hills!",
        "persuasion": "Well... I suppose a weary rescuer is of little use. Very well! But you must promise me you will be ready at the crack of dawn. Volothamp Geddarm's friends do not languish in dungeons for long! This will be a tale for the ages, and its heroes must be properly prepared!"
