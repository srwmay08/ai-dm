I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur's Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence. My friend's name is Floon Blagmaar. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped-or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?",

        "reaction": "Good heavens, a long rest? Do you have any idea what could be happening to my dear Floon right now? Every moment we delay is another moment he's in the clutches of those fiends! I haven't seen such a lack of urgency since I was chased out of a dragon's lair in the Serpent Hills!",
